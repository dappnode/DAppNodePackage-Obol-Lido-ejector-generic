# DAppNodePackage-Obol-Lido-ejector-generic

This dappnode package is needed by operators running Lido's SDVT using Obol. It encompasses the necessary tools to pre-generate, sign and submit voluntary exit messages for a Charon cluster.

It is composed of two main services:
- `lido-dv-exit`: a program that automatically pre-generates and signs validator voluntary exit messages for a Charon cluster.
- `validator-ejector`: a service that watches for exit requests (i.e from Lido's on-chain events) and submits the voluntary exit messages generated by `lido-dv-exit`.
